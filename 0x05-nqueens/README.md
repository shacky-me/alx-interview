The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, I had to understand several key concepts and had access to resources that helped me grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Concepts Needed:
- Backtracking Algorithms:
    - Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
    - [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-backtracking-2/)
- Recursion:
    - Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
    - [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
- List Manipulations in Python:
    - Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
    - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- Python Command Line Arguments:
    - Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
    - [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

* By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, I was well equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques. So, yeah!! I did it.
