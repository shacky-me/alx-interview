# Concepts Needed:

1. Matrix Representation in Python:

- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

2. In-place Operations:

- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

3. Matrix Transposition:

- Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

5. Nested Loops:

- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
